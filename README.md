# Introduction
Our model aims to predict the risk of breast cancer using a binary classification approach based on biopsy data. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project comprises biopsy records, including various features such as tumor size, cell shape, margins,and diagnosis information as Malignant (cancerous) or Benign(non cancerous)

# Dataset Split Info
We divided the dataset into training and testing sets with a 70-30 split, ensuring a balanced representation of positive and negative cases in both sets.
and excluded the first 2 colums i.e the sr-no and the ID of the patients whics are not Impacting the training of the model

# Approach
We employed a machine learning model using neural Networks. Feature engineering and normalization were performed to enhance model performance.

# Results
Our model achieved a high accuracy rate of 98.25% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting breast cancer presence.

# Dependencies
Key dependencies includes Rapid Miner Client. 

# Performance and Accuracy
The model's performance was evaluated through precision, recall, and ROC-AUC analysis. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates its robustness in identifying potential breast cancer cases.

# F1 Score
We calculated the F1 score, striking a balance between precision and recall. The F1 score is crucial for assessing the model's effectiveness in handling both false positives and false negatives.
the F1 score is 0.4883

# Novelty Factor
Our project introduces novel feature engineering techniques, contributing to improved predictive capabilities. The incorporation of these features enhances the model's ability to discern subtle patterns in the biopsy data.
